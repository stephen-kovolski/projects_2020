# Movie Rental program

This is my first experience woring with objects

I wanted to create a site that has moives avaialble to rent that will let the user pick a movie and check it out.  Once the customer checks out the movie, it will show up in the rented movies object.  After that, the only option the customer has is to return the movie that is currently out.  Otherwise they can rent any movie is availble and able to be rented.


Currently all movies are "checked out" 

[Version 0.1 code](movie_rental.js)

## So far I have been able to accomplish


[*] post the movie image to the dom from the url found in the object.<br>
[*] Get the name of the movie in respect to the element and the object placement<br>
[*] Get an post the year of release to the client<br>




## Future golas for this program


[] Create the function that will allow the consumer to retrun movies that have been rented <br>
[] Instead of the hyperlink saying "undefined" I need to use the imdb link and have it display correctly<br>
[] use some css to make the site look polished and clean <br>
